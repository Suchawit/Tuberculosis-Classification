# Tuberculosis-Classification
Apply deep learning to classify tuberculosis from chest x-ray images


## Object
to implement a image classication software to predict from chest x-ray whether there is a tubercolosis or not using deep learning technique.

## Requirement

## Preprocessing Data

### Reshape

### Augmentation


## Model Implementation

1) [Sequential]()
2) [ResNet]()
3) [Transfer learning, MobileNetV2]() 



## Result

These three models were trained for 100. From these results, it shows that Transfer Learning model obtained highest accuracy, but validation and training accuracies of other models are still slowly increasing.

### Sequential model
