## Object
To implement a image classication software to predict from chest x-ray whether there is a tubercolosis or not using deep learning technique.

## Dataset


## Requirement

## Preprocessing Data
Create binary classes from Pandas dataframe:

Connect dataframe with images in specific directory with flow_from_dataframe command:

`C:\\Users\\non_n\\Desktop\\Input\\sample\\images\\` path is where all images is stored

### Augmentation
To generate more data to be trained in the model using this command:

## Model Implementation

1) [Sequential](https://github.com/Suchawit/Tuberculosis-Classification/blob/main/Model/Xray_Seq.py)
2) [ResNet](https://github.com/Suchawit/Tuberculosis-Classification/blob/main/Model/Xray_ResNet.py)
3) [Transfer learning, MobileNetV2](https://github.com/Suchawit/Tuberculosis-Classification/blob/main/Model/Xray_Transfer_Learning.py) 



## Result

These three models were trained for 100. From these results, it shows that Transfer Learning model obtained highest accuracy with 85% validation accuracy, but validation and training accuracies of ResNet model are still slowly increasing, and Sequential model seems not suitable for this dataset
